# Active Context - EFB Integration Task

## Current Task
**Integration into EFB and training environments**

## Context Analysis
The user has requested integration into "EFB and training environments" but the specific meaning of EFB in this context needs clarification. Based on the search through the codebase, there are no existing references to EFB functionality.

## Possible EFB Interpretations
1. **Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)** - Aviation industry digital platform for flight operations
2. **Enterprise Feedback (EFB)** - Internal feedback system
3. **External Function Block (EFB)** - Industrial automation component
4. **Custom acronym** - Project-specific or organization-specific meaning

## Current Project State
- PipesHub AI is a workplace AI platform for enterprise search and Q&A
- Supports multiple connectors (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, etc.)
- Has modular architecture with Python microservices
- Includes AI agents and conversational interfaces
- Ready for deployment via Docker

## Required Information
To proceed with the EFB integration task, I need clarification on:

1. **What does EFB stand for in this context?**
2. **What specific integration requirements are needed?**
3. **What training environments are being referenced?**
4. **Are there existing EFB systems to integrate with?**
5. **What functionality should be exposed to EFB systems?**

## Next Steps
1. Request clarification from user about EFB meaning and requirements
2. Once clarified, analyze integration points within PipesHub architecture
3. Design integration approach (API endpoints, connectors, or embedded components)
4. Implement integration solution
5. Test integration with training environments

## Technical Considerations
Based on PipesHub's architecture, potential integration approaches could include:
- **API Integration**: Expose PipesHub functionality via REST APIs
- **Connector Development**: Create new connector for EFB data sources
- **Embedded Components**: Provide embeddable search/chat widgets
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time data synchronization
- **SSO Integration**: Unified authentication with EFB systems
